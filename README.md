  Most of us have been huge fans of Pokemon since childhood. It is React project using PokeAPI. Here you can fetch the Pokemon details or their characteristics through this API. Make different cards for each Pokemon and on each card show their pictures, their names, etc. You can make a “read more” button on a Pokemon card, by clicking those buttons users will get to know more things about each Pokemon. To generate more and more Pokemons, create a button too much that on clicking that button, users will get to see more Pokemon cards.
